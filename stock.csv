The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Apple is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price

S P 500  SPY 

Stocks finished the day yesterday lower following disappointing ISM PMI data coming in at 48 1 versus estimates of 49 4  It correlated to a GDP growth rate of 1 5   Not great  but considering the fears we had at this time than last year  it s not that bad either 

However  the S P 500 did fall by about 80 basis points to 3 115  The SPX bounced right off of support at 3 110  But  it also fell through the uptrend we had been monitoring throughout November  Even worse  we see that the SPX failed to retake the uptrend when it tried late on Monday afternoon 

The good news is the RSI fell sharply  from roughly 75 to 58  The bad news is that the RSI still likely needs to fall further  That said  I think that the S P 500 still has some further to fall  perhaps to around 3 080
